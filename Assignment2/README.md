#Smart Contract Based Loan Repayment
This is the implementation of a smart contract in which the owner initially has a balance of 100K MetaCoins acquired by taking loans. The debt the owner owes to a particular node is stored in a mapping called loans and is updated once a given node requests for the loan using ReqLoan function. The owner can view the dues that he/she has to a given node and choose to settle it.
